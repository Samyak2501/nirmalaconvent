        <p class="extract-1">Six humans trapped by happenstance <br> In bleak and bitter cold. <br> Each one possessed a stick of wood Or so the srory's told.</p>
        <p class="question-1">(i) What brought the 'six humans' together ? Where were they ?</p>
        <p class="ans-1"> <strong>Ans.</strong> The bitter cold climate brought the six men together by chance. They were huddled by the side of a fire that was on the verge of dying out any moment with a stick in each man’s hand. <br> <br>
            All of them were from different backgrounds and each man would actually never have liked to be seen with the other members of the group. Each man had his own reason for hatred towards at least one of his five companions. <br> <br>
            Because of this vice towards one another, no one was ready to push his on log into the dying fire to kindle it once again and enhance the warmth of the surrounding. The poet ruses over the fact that the minds of the people were a lot colder than the climate.</p>
        <p class="question-2">(ii) What each of them possessed ? What use of it was made by each of them ?</p>
        <p class="ans-2"><strong>Ans.</strong> Each of them possessed a stick.there is a symbolic significance of the logs of wood after reading the whole poem we realise that the stick in each hand is a symbol of since these person could have helped one another and save themselves from Death.
        </p>
        <p class="question-3">(iii) Is there any significance of the logs of wood in the hands of six persond ?</p>
        <p class="ans-3"><strong>Ans.</strong>
            The logs of wood in the hands of the six people indicates the HUMAN SIN . It clearly states that all six not died due to the cold outside, but the cold within that is jealous , racial discrimination , selfish , poor and rich .</p>
        <p class="question-4">(iv) What could these persons have done ?</p>
        <p class="ans-4"><strong>Ans.</strong> Each person could have relinquished his log to keep the fire going and could have saved each other from dying in the cold. Symbolically if they had rid themselves of their sins they could have kept alive the fire of faith and saved themselves from damnation.</p>
        <p class="question-5">(v) What does the 'cold within' signify?</p>
        <p class="ans-5"><strong>Ans.</strong> ‘The cold within’ means the lack of warmth within,bom out of selfishness, greed, arrogance, etc. It is because of these negative feelings, ‘the cold within’, that they do not give up their sticks of wood which could have kept the fire burning and kept them alive.</p>
